      "text": "Status: Finished but in constant expansion\n\nI initially started creating this bot to check out how to make discord bots in python, then it quickly grew and grew as I got more and more ideas. Now it has so many features that I could'nt even list all of them here.\n\nSome of them include:\n• Rocket launch news, automatically sending notification 12h and 10min before every rocket launch\n• A fishing game with over 80 fish and a relatively nice progression curve\n• A command for getting a random Astronomy Picture Of the Day entry right from the NASA API\n• A command to randomly retrieve pet images (cat, dog, duck) from 3 selected APIs\n• A full shop and economy system, which structure allows for easily adding complex new types of items\n• A pokedex feature, which shows all kinds of data fromt he PokeAPI and will be extended in the future\n• An XP/Level system which gives currency as a reward for activity\n• Randomly querying OpenAI to answer specific messages using GPT-4, providing context of 5 messages\n• Custom profiles which you can set in a user-friendly way using a discord modal/form",
